malware - malicious software
types of malware and methods
viruses
worms
ransomware
trojan horse
rootkit
keylogger
spyware
bloatware
logic bomb
how you get malware
diff types all work together
- A worm takes advantage of a vulnerability
- Installs malware that includes a remote access backdoor
- Bot may be installed later

Your computer must run a program
- Email link
- Web page pop-up
- Drive-by download
- Worm

Your computer is vulnerable
- Operating system = Keep updated!
- Applications - Check with the publisher
ransomware
Software that encrypts programs and data until a ransom is paid to remove it.
- OS works = they want you running not working
protecting vs ransomware
always have backup
keep OS/apps updated
keep antivirus/antimalware signatures up to date
virus
malware that can reproduce itself
- needs you to execute

reproduces through file systems or network

may or may not cause problems

anti-virus very common
virus types
program viruses (part of app)

boot sector viruses
- virus runs as system boots up

script viruses
- OS and many other software run scripts = malicious scripts

macro viruses
- common in Microsoft office

fileless virus
fileless virus
very stealthy = does a good job avoiding antivirus

operates in memory
- never installed in file or app
worms
malware that self replicates
- doesnt need you to do anything
- uses the network to spread

can spread really quick

firewalls and IDS/IPS can mitigate worm infestations
- not helpful once worm is inside
spyware
malware that spies on you
- ID theft, affiliate fraud, ads

browser monitoring
keyloggers

can trick you into installing
protecting against spyware
maintain antivirus/antimalware

always know what you're installing

backups

run scans w/ 3rd party software
bloatware
unwanted and potentially harmful software preloaded onto new devices.
- can open your system to exploits
- takes up storage/resources
- system may be slower than expected
removing bloatware
identify and remove manually
- easier said than done

use built in uninstaller on system
using the app's own uninstallers
3rd party uninstallers
always have backup
keyloggers
malware that tracks your keyboard inputs
- sent to bad guys
- circumvents encryption protections

other data logging
- screen logging
- instant messaging
- clipboard logging
etc
logic bomb
waits for a predefined event

time bomb
- triggered by time or date

user event
- triggered by user action

difficult to identify
preventing a logic bomb
hard to recognize
- each is unique

process and procedures
- change control

electronic monitoring
- alert on changes

constant auditing
rootkits
originally a unix technique

malware that modifies core system files
- part of kernel

can be invisible to the OS

also invis to traditional antivirus utilities
finding and removin rootkits
look for the unusual
- antimalware scans

use a remover specific to the rootkit
-usually made after its discovered

secure boot with UEFI
- security in the BIOS
- checks to OS signature and confirm nothing has changed before booting
physical attacks
the old fashioned way

types:
brute force
brute force
push through obstruction for access

check your doors, windows, locks, etc
RFID cloning
duplicating RFID on access badges, key fobs, etc

takes seconds
- read one card
- copy to another

why we have MFA
environmental attack
attack stuff supporting the technology
- HVAC
- power
- fire suppression system
DNS poisoning
diff ways:

modify the DNS server itself
- requires crafty hacking

modify the client host file
- the host file takes precedent over DNS queries
- host file has lists of domain names and IP addresses

send fake responses to valid DNS requests
- requires redirection of the original request or the response
- real time redirection
- on path attack
DNS spoofing/poisoning
When an IP address is maliciously changed in a DNS server so that traffic is redirected to a fake website
domain hijacking
get access to the domain registration and you have control where the traffic flows
- dont need to touch the actual servers
- determines the DNS names and DNS IP addresses

many ways to get into the account:
- brute force
- social engineer the password
- gain access to the email address that manages the acc
URL hijacking
can:

redirecting users to malicious sites with ads = $$ for attacker

sell the badly spelled domain to the actual owner
- sell a mistake

redirect traffic to a competitor
- not as common, legal issues

present a phishing site
- steal login info

infect with a drive by download
- malware!
types of URL hijacking
typosquatting/brandjacking
- take adv of poor spelling

outright misspelling
- professormesser.com vs professormessor.com

a typing error
- professormeser.com

a different phrase
- professormessers.com

diff top level domain
- professormesser.org
(instead of .com)
wireless deauthentication
a significant wireless DoS attack
- suddenly disconnects people off of wifi
802.11 management frames
802.11 wireless includes frames that make everything work
• You never see them

Important for the operation of 802.11 wireless
• How to find access points, manage QoS, associate/disassociate with an access point, etc.

Original wireless standards did not add protection for management frames
• Sent in the clear
• No authentication or validation
protecting against deauth attacks
updates with 802.11ac

important management frames are now encrypted
- disassociate, deauth, etc

not everything tho
- beacons, probes, auth, association
radio frequency (RF) jamming
DoS

transmit interfering wireless signals
- decrease signal to noise ratio at receiving device
- receiving device cant hear good signal

jamming is intentional
types of wireless jamming
constant - constantly blocking

random- data sent at random times

legit - microwave/traffic

reactive - only when someone tries to communicate

needs to be somewhere close
- fox hunting
- directional antenna, attenuator needed
on path network attack
aka man-in-the-middle

redirects your traffic and passes it on to the destination
- you never know

ex: ARP poisoning
ARP poisoning
An attack that corrupts the ARP cache (table of MAC and IP addresses)
- attacker poisons the cache for the victim and router
- so they can sit in the middle
- on local IP subnet; attacker has to be on it
on path browser attack
malware/trojan does the proxy work and is able to redirect traffic before and after it is sent to the network

aka man-in-the-browser

huge advantage
- even if network traffic was encrypted, attacker still sees it
- everything looks normal to victim
replay attack
A type of network attack where an attacker captures network traffic and stores it for retransmission at a later time to gain unauthorized access to a network

need access to raw network data

avoided using encryption or salting of the password
browser cookies
information stored on your computer by the browser
- used for tracking, personalization, session management

not executable, not security risk usually
- unless someone gets access to them
- privacy risk
session hijacking (sidejacking)
attackers using session IDs given to users by servers for unauthorized access
- server thinks the attacker is the victim

prevention
- encryption (HTTPS, VPNs, etc)
Header Manipulation
An attack that modifies HTTP headers so they contain malicious information, such as harmful commands and scripts.
malicious code
diff forms:

executable, scripts, macro viruses, worms, trojan horse, etc

protection has to come from many diff places
- firewalls, anti-malware, updates, etc
injection attacks
code injection
- adding your own info into a data stream

enabled from bad programming
- shouldnt be allowed

many diff injectable data types
HTML
SQL
XML
LDAP
etc
types of application attacks
buffer overflows
code injection
replay attack
privilege escalation
cross-site requests
privilege escalation
gain higher level access to a system

high priority to patch

mitigating:
patching
updating antivirus/anti-malware
data execution prevention
- only data in executable areas can run
website code
client and server side code

client side
- renders pages on screen
- HTML, JavaScript

server side
- performs requests from client
- HTML, PHP
cross-site request forgery
1 click attack, session riding
- XSRF, CSRF (sea surf)

takes adv of the trust that a web app has for the user
- website trusts your browser
- requests are made without your consent or knowledge
directory traversal/path traversal
-Read/write files from a web server that are outside of the website's file directory
-Users shouldn't be able to browse the Windows folder

sometimes its software vulnerability

sometimes its web app code vulnerability
cryptographic attacks
attackers attack the cryptography itself instead of trying to get the encrypted data
- break the "safe" since they dont have the key

find ways to undo the security
- the problem is often the implementation
birthday attack (cryptographic attacks)
finding a hash collision using brute force

- protect yourself with large has output sizes
hash collision
Occurs when the hashing algorithm creates the same hash from different texts
downgrade attack (cryptographic attacks)
A type of attack that forces a system to downgrade its security/encryption. The attacker then exploits the lesser security control.

ex: SSL stripping
SSL stripping (cryptographic attacks)
combines an on path attack with a downgrade attack
- hard to implement but big reward if possible
- attacker must sit in the middle of the convo
- strips the encryption between the victim and web server
spraying attack (password attacks)
attack an account by trying to login with the top 3 or 4 most common passwords
- if it doesnt work move on
brute force attack (password attacks)
try every password combination until hash is matched
- can take time
- usually done offline

strong hashing algo slows things down
indicators of compromise (IOC)
an event that indicates intrusion
- high confidence

indicators
- unusual amount of network activity
- change to file hash values
- irregular international traffic
- change to DNS data
etc
account lockout (IOC)
exceeded login attempts
- wasnt you

could be administratively disabled
- larger concern

may be part of a larger plan
- attacker locks acc, calls help desk impersonating you to reset password
concurrent session usage (IOC)
multiple acc logins from multiple locations
- can be hard to track down
blocked content (IOC)
attacker wants to stay as long as possible
- blocks security patches, updates, removal tools, etc
impossible travel (IOC)
impossible travel in authentication logs can be a sign of intrusion
resource consumption (IOC)
if resource consumption spikes at unusual times or is higher than usual

firewall logs show the outgoing transfer
- IP addresses, timeframes

often first real notification of issue
resource inaccessibility (IOC)
server being down
- not responding

network disruption
- cover for the actual exploit

server outage
- result of an exploit gone wrong

encrypted data
out of cycle logging (IOC)
logs that occur at an unexpected time

check firewall log activity
missing logs (IOC)
log info is evidence
- attackers delete logs to cover tracks

logs may be incriminating
- missing logs are suspicious
- logs should be secured and monitored
published/documented info (IOC)
company data may be published online
- can be combined with ransomware
